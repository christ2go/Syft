Compilation Instructions for Syft using CMake

These instructions were tested on Ubuntu. They also work on RHEL 8, and should work on most linux distributions (with minor adjustments).

==== Install CUDD ====

0.1 Make sure CUDD is installed. CUDD can be found at:
    https://github.com/KavrakiLab/cudd.git

   You can first clone this repository using ``git clone https://github.com/KavrakiLab/cudd.git``. Then ``cd cudd``, then proceed with the instructions to install it.

0.2 Install CUDD:
    ./configure --enable-silent-rules --enable-obj --enable-dddmp --prefix=[install location]
    sudo make install

    If you get an error about aclocal, this might be due to either
    a. Not having automake:
       sudo apt-get install automake
    b. Needing to reconfigure, do this before configuring:
       autoreconf -i

Please take note of the path where CUDD is installed (the prefix, if you set that variable), you might need it later for configuring Syft.

==== Install FLEX, BISON ====

0.3 Install flex and bison:
    sudo apt-get install flex bison

==== Install MONA ====

0.4 You probably want MONA if you are using Syft:
    sudo apt-get install mona

If you do not install MONA but, e.g., compile it from source and do not install it, make sure that the MONA executable is in your ``$PATH`` environment variable, as Syft calls MONA using that.

==== INSTALL BOOST === 

0.5 Syft requires the Boost C++ libraries. 
   sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

==== Install Syft ====

1. Make build folder so your directory is not flooded with build files:

   mkdir build && cd build

2. Run CMake to generate the makefile:

   cmake .. 

You might have to hint the CUDD location to CMake, if CUDD is not found. 
To do this, run cmake with the additional flag ``cmake .. -DCUDD_ROOT=path_to_cudd_install``.

3. Compile using the generated makefile:

   cmake --build .
